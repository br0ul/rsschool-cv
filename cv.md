### Briefly About Myself:

A couple years ago I started my IT career. My children grew up and I was ready to work.
At first I tried as 1C consultant. But very soon I knew about chat-bot constructors and became a chat-bot developer.
Very soon I understood I need Python to do more interesting things. I studied it to some required for my tasks level.
And sometimes I made some frontend tasks for clients's landings. So i studied basic HTML, CSS, JS. 
I want to be able develop interesting tasks so I always improve my skills.
This way I came to rsschool to become a proficient Frontend or Fullstack Developer.

        $.ajax({

            method: 'get',
            async: false,
            success: function(data) {
                theResponse = data;
